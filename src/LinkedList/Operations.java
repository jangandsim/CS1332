 * CS 2110 Spring 2017 HW2
 * Part 3 - Coding with bitwise operators
 *
 * @author YOUR NAME HERE
 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - All of these functions must be completed in ONE line. That means they should be
 *   of the form "return [...];", with a single semicolon. No partial credit will be
 *   awarded for any Method that isn't completed in one line.
 *     Hint: If you are stuck trying to complete one of these functions in one line,
 *     try completing them in multiple lines first, given the constraints below. For
 *     example, if you wanted to calculate the distance between two points:
 *       int x1, x2, y1, y2;
 *       int dx = x1 - x2;
 *       int dx2 = dx * dx;
 *       int dy = y1 - y2;
 *       int dy2 = dy * dy;
 *       int zsum = dx2 + dy2;
 *       int ans = (int) sqrt(zsum);
 *     By inspection, you can substitute the expressions into different lines:
 *       int x1, x2, y1, y2;
 *       int dx2 = (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2)
 *       int dy2 = (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)
 *       int ans = (int) sqrt(dx2 + dy2)
 *     And finally:
 *       int x1, x2, y1, y2;
 *       int ans = (int) sqrt((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2));
 *     If your multiline solution can't be reduced to 1 line, you're doing it wrong.
 *
 * - You may not use more than 2 conditionals per method, which for this file would
 *   just be ternary expressions.
 * - You may not declare any variables.
 * - You may not use casting.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any other method from this or
 *   another file to implement any method.
 * - In functions where addition or subtraction is allowed, you may only do so
 *   with the number 1.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus in any method.
 * - You may not use addition, subtraction, or conditionals in setByte,
 *   getShort, pack, or xor.
 * - You noy not use bitshifting or the exclusive OR operator (^) in xor.
 *
 * Finally, your code must be robust and concise. If we asked you to print out the values 1 through 100
 * and you wrote 100 separate print statements, then sure, it works, but no one's gonna hire a coder who does
 * that. Likewise, you will NOT get credit for verbose answers for which there is a much more concise
 * solution. For instance, if you need to shift a value by n*4 times, you may not write x << n << n << n << n
 * or you will get no credit, because there is a much more concise way to do this in only two operations by
 * first shifting n. Keep this in mind, ESPECIALLY in the first 2 functions in this file.
 *
 * Remember that for this assignment, All bit masks must be written in hexadecimal.
 * This is the convention for masks and makes it much easier for the programmer to
 * understand the code. If you write a mask in any other base you will lose points.
 *
 * All of these functions accept ints as parameters because if you pass in a number
 * (which is of type int by default) into a Method accepting a byte, then the Java
 * compiler will complain even if the number would fit into that type.
 *
 * Now, keep in mind the return value is also an int. Please read the comments about how
 * many significant bits to return and make sure that the other bits are not set or else
 * you will not get any points for that test case.
 * i.e if I say to return 6 bits and you return 0xFFFFFFFF, you will lose points.
 *
 * Definitions of types:
 * nibble - 4 bits
 * byte   - 8 bits
 * short  - 16 bits
 * int    - 32 bits
